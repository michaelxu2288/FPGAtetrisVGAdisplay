This project was built off of lab 6.2, so to run the project you only need to replace mb_usb_top  with the sv file here + replace ball.sv with the tetris.sv file

There are no external IPs or anything so you can just run the project after generating the bitstream and using lab62 code for getting keycodes

Use WASD to control blocks (W for rotating and S for quick drop) and everything else is just basic Tetris
